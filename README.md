# ACI_LAYER1_CHECK
 Python Code that allows Network Engineers to run through their ACI Infrastructure for Layer 1 availability and compare to a set of interfaces that reflects their tenant computing a health score

## Overview
![High Level Workflow](Overview.jpg)


**Device/Interface Health**: 

The idea of the health check is to provide visibility into possible layer 1 problems within the network. The combination of the output CLI commands "show interface status" , "show etherchannel summary", and "show interfaces" would provide insights to interfaces not up and error counters on the interfaces. 

**Python**

The script is written in python using parsers from the genie library to convert cli output into structured data 

**Genie** 

**Output**: The results of the CLI commands are stored in simple .txt file: (L1.txt) ![Sample Output](OutputSnapshot-001.jpg)
