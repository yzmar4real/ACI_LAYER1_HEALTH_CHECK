# ACI_LAYER1_CHECK
 Python Code that allows Network Engineers to run through their ACI Infrastructure for Layer 1 availability and compare to a set of interfaces that reflects their tenant computing a health score

## Overview
![High Level Workflow](Overview.jpg)


**Device/Interface Health**: 

The idea of the health check is to provide visibility into possible layer 1 problems within the network fabric. The script runs to check for interfaces that are down and compares them with expected set of interfaces and computes a health percentage score. 

**Python**

The script is written in python using acitoolkit to interact with APIC,and computation based on defined set of interfaces.

**Output**: The results of the CLI commands are stored in simple .txt file: (L1_Output.txt, L1_Health.txt) ![Sample Output](Output_Snapshot.JPG)

You can also find the results of a full run in the text file (Result.txt)

2. Run the docker image 

docker run -it --name acitoolkit dockercisco/acitoolkit


## Step 1 - Downloading - Option B Using GIT

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/datacenter/acitoolkit.git

2. Install ACITOOLKIT library

cd acitoolkit
python setup.py install

## Step 2 - Script Setup

1. Clone this repository into your desired directory using the command:

git clone https://github.com/yzmar4real/ACI_LAYER1_CHECK.git

2. CD into the directory
